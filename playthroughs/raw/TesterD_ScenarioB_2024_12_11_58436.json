Your worn leather boots and weathered clothing speak of a life spent under the open sky. You've been a member of the Artigas army, and the weight of your experiences is evident in your eyes. \\n\\nAs you look around, you notice a few things that catch your attention. On the wall, someone has scrawled a message: 'You have to trust in the powers that have been given to you.' The words seem to resonate deep within you, perhaps because you possess a magical power - the ability to summon a giant wave of water. You've used it to put out fires and quench the parched earth before, but now, it feels like a distant memory.\\n\\nNearby, a pond glimmers in the dappled light, its crystal clear water reflecting the trees above like a mirror. The tranquility of the scene is a balm to your weary soul. You also notice that you're holding a classic guitar, its six strings waiting to be strummed.

The space is surprisingly lush, with plants that have grown in from outside, covering the walls and floor. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and greenery. You're holding a classic guitar with 6 strings, its smooth wood a comforting weight in your hands. As you look around, you notice JosÃ© Artigas, Uruguay's national hero, sitting weakly in the corner of the cell, his eyes sunken from his long imprisonment. The silence is oppressive, and you can't help but feel a sense of unease. Ahead of you, a doorway leads out into the Silent Zone, the only exit from this tiny, confined space.\n\n\n\nðŸŽ¯You have completed your quest!"
