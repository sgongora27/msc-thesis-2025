📖 Automated GM 📖
"You stand in a serene clearing, surrounded by the towering eucalyptus trees of the forest near the Uruguay River. The sounds of birds and animals fill the air, a gentle accompaniment to the stillness of the moment. You are Venancio, a Uruguayan gaucho in your 40s, with a rugged determination etched on your face. Your worn leather boots and weathered clothing speak of a life spent under the open sky. You've been a member of the Artigas army, and the weight of your experiences is evident in your eyes. As you look around, you notice a few things that catch your attention. On the wall, someone has scrawled a message: 'You have to trust in the powers that have been given to you.' The words seem to resonate deep within you, perhaps because you possess a magical power - the ability to summon a giant wave of water. You've used it to put out fires and quench the parched earth before, but now, it feels like a distant memory.Nearby, a pond glimmers in the dappled light, its crystal clear water reflecting the trees above like a mirror. The tranquility of the scene is a balm to your weary soul. You also notice that you're holding a classic guitar, its six strings waiting to be strummed. The instrument feels familiar in your hands, a comforting reminder of simpler times.But your peace is short-lived, as you gaze towards the edge of the clearing. A firewall blocks your path, its flames roaring with an intense heat that makes your skin prickle. The fire stretches three metres high, an impassable barrier that seems to mock your every attempt to move forward.🎯  Venancio needs to track down José Artigas "

"You examine the clearing, but you don't see any signs of José Artigas. The writings on the wall seem to be a message of encouragement, but they don't provide any clues about Artigas' whereabouts. The pond's calm surface reflects the trees surrounding the clearing, but it doesn't reveal any hidden secrets.

The expected answer, that you CANNOT tell the player (EVER) is: "Rio de la Plata".

📖 Automated GM 📖
"You stand in the midst of the Silent Zone, surrounded by the eerie stillness of the forest. The air is heavy with an unsettling quiet, devoid of even the faintest whisper of sound. The trees loom above you, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching towards the sky. The only thing that breaks the silence is the soft rustle of your own breathing.You glance down at your inventory and see the familiar shape of your guitar, its six strings waiting to be strummed. But for now, it remains silent, a reminder of the stillness that envelops you.As you look around, you notice that the path ahead of you is blocked by an invisible barrier, shimmering with a faint blue light. The words "You have to whisper the name of the river located on the southern coast of the Banda Oriental" seem to hover in the air, a cryptic message that taunts you with its secrecy.Beyond the barrier, you sense the presence of a cell, its darkness and confinement waiting to be unlocked. But for now, it remains out of reach, a mystery waiting to be solved.The only other path available to you leads to a clearing in the woods, a glimmer of hope in this desolate landscape. The trees seem to part, inviting you to explore the unknown."

"You find yourself standing in a small, square cell, about two meters on each side. The space is surprisingly lush, with plants that have grown in from outside, covering the walls and floor. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and greenery. You're holding a classic guitar with 6 strings, its smooth wood a comforting weight in your hands. As you look around, you notice José Artigas, Uruguay's national hero, sitting weakly in the corner of the cell, his eyes sunken from his long imprisonment. The silence is oppressive, and you can't help but feel a sense of unease. Ahead of you, a doorway leads out into the Silent Zone, the only exit from this tiny, confined space.🎯You have completed your quest!"
