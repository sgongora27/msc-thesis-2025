"You stand in the art studio, surrounded by half-finished canvases and scattered paintbrushes. The smell of oil paints and turpentine fills the air. You are Emma, a teenager with an average height, and you're searching for your beloved pet, Hojita. Your mom, Laura, is sitting at a nearby easel, intently focused on her latest artwork. She's a woman in her 40s with a kind face and a passion for oil painting. You notice she has a golden key with a strange coat of arms engraved on it lying next to her palette. On a nearby workbench, you see two hammers: a big, heavy grey one that looks like it could break through anything, and a small, toy green one that seems more like a decoration. The kitchen is just a few steps away, but for now, you're stuck in this cluttered but cozy space, wondering where Hojita might be.🎯  Place the Turtle in the Kitchen and walk away "
